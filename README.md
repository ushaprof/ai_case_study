[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/technology/waymo-expansion-alphabet.html)


### Cost Structure:
**R&D Costs:** Waymo invests heavily in research and development, particularly in AI
and machine learning, as well as in hardware for autonomous vehicles.

> 	Saswat Panigrahi, Waymo’s chief product officer, said in an interview that the company was betting that its fixed costs, like the expense of lidar sensors and the number of human monitors it needs, will decrease over time. [The Daily Podcast, the NYTimes.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/podcasts/the-daily/driverless-cars-san-francisco.html)


**Operational Costs:** Operating a fleet of autonomous vehicles, maintaining infrastructure, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements are significant cost drivers.

> 	Waymo’s sixth-generation vehicles, which it started testing in July, will also lower costs, Mr. Panigrahi added. “So, as we swap these fleets out, the profitability will jump further,” he said. A Chinese electric automaker, Zeekr, makes the new vehicles. [The Daily Podcast, the NYTimes.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/podcasts/the-daily/driverless-cars-san-francisco.html)

## WAYMO BUSINESS RISK ANALYSIS 

### Opportunities for Growth:

**Global Expansion:**  Expanding to international markets represents a significant growth opportunity, provided Waymo can navigate the regulatory and operational challenges.

**AI Innovation:** Ongoing innovation in AI and machine learning could enhance the capabilities of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles, potentially opening new revenue streams.

> 	“Artificial intelligence has triggered a significant transformation of human society that involves a stronger human-machine partnership.”  Says Marius Stan, Program Lead, Intelligent Materials Design at the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory. The forecast calls for stronger, speedier resolution through quicker innovation. [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/article/the-new-sciencemachine-partnerships)


### Challenges and Risks:

**Technological Risks:** Developing reliable and safe AI-driven autonomous vehicles is complex, and any setbacks could impact Waymo’s market position.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/technology/waymo-expansion-alphabet.html)

**Collaborative Innovation:** Might result in copyright, and intellectual property fraud, choking revenue streams.

**Regulatory Compliance:** This is a slow, deliberative process—collaborating with regulatory agencies such as NHTSA is the surest way to gain public regard in the long run.

**Public Trust and Acceptance:** Gaining public trust is crucial for the adoption of autonomous vehicles, and any incidents could set back progress significantly.

>	“Waymo has not had the big crash yet,” said Phil Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in autonomous vehicles. “I don’t know if they will have a big, embarrassing, problematic crash, and based upon the data, they don’t know, either.”  [The Daily Podcast, the NYTimes.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/podcasts/the-daily/driverless-cars-san-francisco.html)


## WAYMO WAY FORWARD UPSIDES
Waymo’s integration of AI into its business strategy has made it a leader in the autonomous driving industry. However, the company faces significant challenges in scaling operations, achieving profitability, and gaining regulatory approval. Continued innovation and strategic partnerships will be critical for Waymo’s long-term success.

### WAYMO Recommendations

**Expand Partnerships:** Waymo should continue to seek out partnerships with automakers, logistics companies, and technology providers to scale its AI technology. YouTube is an excellent in-house example of how to expand a brand continuously across platforms and industries.

**Focus on Cost Efficiency:** Improving cost efficiency will be key to achieving profitability in the highly competitive AI and autonomous vehicle markets.

> 	It’s unclear exactly how much money Alphabet is spending on Waymo, but a collection of Alphabet’s experimental businesses that includes Waymo had an operating loss of about $2 billion in the first half of this year. “Waymo most likely accounted for a significant portion of that loss,” said Mark Mahaney, the head of Evercore ISI’s internet research team.  [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/technology/waymo-expansion-alphabet.html)

**Focus on increasing Voluntary Public adoption/buy-in through enhancing immersive experiences:**

>	Waymo’s head of product and customer research Megan Neese says the company is in the process of fine-tuning location accuracy of drop-offs and pick-ups and optimizing the music experience.  Features like Google Voice Assistant, cabin configuration for productivity, and entertainment, are near-term possibilities. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martineparis/2024/08/24/waymo-has-5-billion-google-ai-and-super-fans-can-amazon-tesla-and-uber-compete/) Very likely, Waymo is a Google sib after all.


**Safety Awareness Campaigns relating to Autonomous Vehicles:** Imperative to launch immersive, responsive, updated public information campaigns on SAFETY of vehicles, technology, public, roads, buildings, and more. Analogous to aviation safety protocols, regulations, zoning, noise and traffic control roles and responsibilities.

> 	"The way you build trust is to be transparent," says Advocates president Cathy Chase. She says AV companies should be candid: "'These are the limitations of the vehicle. These are our concerns. This is what we're trying to overcome." But Chase says, "We don't see that."   "It's not about blame," echoes Edwin Olson, CEO of May Mobility. "It's about learning" what improvements are needed. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/technology/waymo-expansion-alphabet.html)

##CASE STUDY TAKEAWAY--Like human drivers, self-driving technology will never be perfect — but people will surely come to trust it more if they better understand its failings.
